### What is it ??? ###
######################

hobbit-games.sh is a game server monitoring plugin for Hoobitmon/Xymon (http://hobbitmon.sourceforge.net/)
It's fully GPL, so you can do whatever you want with, but it will keep GPL for ever.

It's not maintained anymore, and has never been tested on anything else than Wolfenstein:Enemy Territory and Warsow game servers. Due to Quakestat usage, it should run on any games supported by Quakestat.

### What are the pre-requisites ? ###
#####################################

You first need to have a Hobbitmon/Xymon server running. This script is client-side script, so it must be installed by a Hobbitmon/Xymon client.
It uses : awk, tail and head commands. They are provided on most Linux based OS. Just check in hobbit-games.sh the path are correct.
It also needs Quakestat, path to quakestat is defined by :
QUAKESTAT="/usr/bin/quakestat"

### How does it works ? ###
###########################

The script check for game servers status and reports results to Hobbitmon/Xymon server. According to the results, it'll tell monitoring server if the game servers are running/down...
The game server list is provided in hobbit-games.conf
Use the following syntax to add your game servers :
gametype,host:port
Example :
warsows,stan.makelofine.org:44400
Gametype are listed in hobbit-games.conf

#########################################################
### How could I check activity ? ###
#########################################################

There is a debug mode included, first, you need to edit hobbit-games.sh, and define the following regarding to your configuration :

AWK="/usr/bin/awk"
SED="/bin/sed"
TAIL="/usr/bin/tail"
CAT="/bin/cat"
GREP="/bin/grep"
RM="/bin/rm"
DATE="/bin/date"
HEAD="/usr/bin/head"

The default values are correct on a Debian system.
Then, you juste have to run :
./hobbit-games.sh game server_ip:server_port

And you'll have the reports sent to monitoring server.
